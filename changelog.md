Again, not much progress today. Reading more into jekyll (a static site generator in Ruby).

# 10-11/01/2016

Not much progress today. Doing a lot of reading so didn't find the time to continue with bootstrap.

# 09/01/2016

Continuing the bootstrap section of the course now. Taking on this project has been very educational though. Having a problem to solve or an outcome in mind
helps focus in on achieving that outcome, rather than simply learning things for the sake of learning.

Apply everything you learn as soon as possible to solve real world problems right away. Focus on the end result.

# 08/01/2016

Made index page with bootstrap to link all parts of project so far.

Took version 2 of jquery project offline due to javascript security risk, as Rob mentions. 

Version 1 will stay on the website for now.
