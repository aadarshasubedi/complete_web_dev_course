Continuing the bootstrap sectio nof course now. Taking on this project has been very educational though. Having a problem to solve or an outcome in mind
helps focus in on achieving that outcome, rather than simply learning things for the sake of learning.

Apply everything you learn as soon as possible to solve real world problems right away. Focus on the end result.

Took version 2 of jquery project offline due to javascript security risk, as Rob mentions. 

Version 1 will stay on the website for now.
